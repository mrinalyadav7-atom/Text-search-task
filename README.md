# Text-search-task
## Extracting keywords is one of the most important tasks while working with text data in the domain of Text Mining, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.
There are many applications of text search such as following:
1.	Readers benefit from keywords because they can judge more quickly whether the given text is worth reading or not.
2.	Website makers benefit from keywords because they can group similar content by their topics.
3.	Algorithm programmers benefit from keywords because they reduce the dimensionality of text to the most important features.

## Problem Statement:
Text search on a huge amount of single-page PDFs in order to rank them on their relevance with the keywords provided as input to the user.
